# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Agents & Arbiters** is a multi-agent text adventure game built as a TypeScript monorepo using npm workspaces. The concept uses multiple AI agents (location, items, NPCs) to react to player input, with an arbiter synthesizing responses into a coherent game experience. Redis will store game state for persistence.

Current architecture:

- **`packages/ana-web/`** (@ana/web) - Svelte 5 frontend with terminal-style game interface
- **`packages/ana-api/`** (@ana/api) - Azure Functions v4 API with game loop endpoints
- **`packages/shared/`** - Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
- **`packages/agent-memory-server/`** - Containerized Agent Memory Server (Python-based placeholder)
- **`data/redis/`** - Persistent Redis data storage for local development
- **`infrastructure/`** - Infrastructure as Code (Bicep templates for Azure deployment)

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- **Basic game loop**: Terminal UI with command input and history display
- **API endpoints**: `/api/version` and `/api/take-turn` (currently echoes input with 1.5s delay)
- **Feature-based architecture**: Organized by views/features instead of component types
- **View-model pattern**: Centralized state management with proper encapsulation
- **Law of Demeter compliance**: Clean public interfaces hiding implementation details

- **LLM integration**: OpenAI client with structured input/output using Zod schemas
- **Domain entities**: Class-based GameEntity, LocationEntity, and FixtureEntity with builder pattern
- **Rich game world**: Atmospheric descriptions for "The Shrine of Forgotten Whispers" with detailed fixtures
- **Intelligent routing**: LLM-powered classifier for agent selection with reasoning
- **Parallel execution**: Conditional fan-out supporting single or multiple agent execution
- **Agent input filtering**: Factory pattern for clean message filtering per agent type
- **Structured agent output**: All agents (classifier, location, fixture, arbiter) use Zod schemas for consistent output
- **Arbiter synthesis**: Fan-in node combining agent responses into final narrative with structured output
- **Dynamic graph building**: Class-based MultiAgentGraph with JavaScript private fields and factory patterns
- **Clean organization**: Domain-based folders (domain/, agent/, game/) with proper separation of concerns

### ðŸš§ Next Steps

- Add committer component for handling state changes from arbiter output
- Replace stubbed domain entities with Redis integration  
- Add NPC agent types and implementations
- Deploy to Azure with AMR and Azure Container Apps

## Development Commands

### Full-stack Development

```bash
docker compose up     # Start Redis + Agent Memory Server containers
npm run dev           # Build all packages, then start SWA + Functions in parallel
```

### Individual Package Development

```bash
npm run dev --workspace=@ana/web      # SWA CLI with Functions integration
npm run dev --workspace=@ana/api      # Azure Functions Core Tools (standalone)
```

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run build         # Build all packages in parallel
npm run build --workspace=@ana/web    # Vite production build
npm run build --workspace=@ana/api    # TypeScript compilation to dist/
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run check --workspace=@ana/web    # Svelte + TypeScript checking
```

## Architecture Details

### Monorepo Structure

- **Root level tooling**: Azure SWA CLI, Azure Functions Core Tools, npm-run-all orchestration
- **Package isolation**: Each package has independent dependencies and build processes
- **Workspace scripts**: Root orchestrates via `npm-run-all --parallel/--sequential`

### Frontend Architecture (@ana/web)

- **Feature-based organization**: `views/game/`, `views/load-game/`, etc. contain related components and ViewModels
- **Shared components**: `components/` with dialogs, LoadingOverlay, Header, Footer for reusable UI elements
- **Dialog system**: Unified base Dialog component with ConfirmationDialog and ErrorDialog specializations
- **API layer**: `services/api.ts` for centralized external service calls and data access
- **Path aliases**: `@views/`, `@components/`, `@services/`, `@app/` for clean imports
- **ViewModel pattern**: Centralized state management with Svelte 5 runes and private fields
- **Dual loading states**: Separate tracking for history loading vs command processing with distinct UX
- **Law of Demeter**: Components interact only with ViewModel public interfaces
- **Autonomous components**: LoadGameCard, LoadGameEmpty handle their own navigation without prop drilling
- **Component extraction**: Complex views broken down into focused, reusable sub-components

### TypeScript Configuration Strategy

Both packages share aligned linting standards but different compilation targets:

- **@ana/web**: Bundler mode (`moduleResolution: "bundler"`) with Vite, no emit
- **@ana/api**: Node.js mode (`moduleResolution: "node"`) with compilation to `dist/`
- **Shared settings**: ES2022 target, strict linting, isolated modules, verbatim module syntax

### Azure Static Web Apps Integration

- **Local development**: SWA CLI proxies `/api/*` requests to Azure Functions on port 7071
- **Production routing**: Configured via `staticwebapp.config.json` with asset exclusions
- **API access**: Functions available at `/api/version` and `/api/take-turn` through SWA

### Styling System

- **Tailwind CSS v4** with custom Redis-themed color palette
- **Custom fonts**: Space Grotesk (sans) and Space Mono (mono) via Google Fonts
- **CSS variables**: Extensive Redis brand colors (redis-midnight, redis-hyper, etc.)

### Container Architecture

- **Redis**: Latest Redis image with persistence to `./data/redis` volume
- **Agent Memory Server**: Python 3.12-based container (placeholder HTTP server on port 8000)
- **Local development**: `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates both services with health checks
- **Future deployment**: Azure Container Apps for AMS, Azure Managed Redis for production

## Environment Configuration

### Node.js Version Management

- Project uses Node.js v20.x (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- Run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version before development
- Required for Azure Functions v4 compatibility

### Azure Functions Local Development

- Copy `packages/ana-api/local.settings.example.json` to `packages/ana-api/local.settings.json`
- Environment variables accessible via `process.env.NODE_ENV`

### Static Web App Environment Variables

- Build-time only via Vite: `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
- No runtime server-side variables (static files served from CDN)

## Key Technical Constraints

- **ES Modules**: All packages use `"type": "module"` for consistency
- **Azure Functions v4**: Modern programming model with `app.http()` registration
- **Svelte 5**: No SvelteKit - plain Svelte with Vite bundler
- **No global installations**: All tooling installed locally via npm workspaces
